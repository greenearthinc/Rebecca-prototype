you definitely need to call me OR talk to me to show you how to train, ideally its going to take you atleast 4-5 hours to train after the dataset generation. Dataset generation takes minimum 20 mins and a maximum of 2 hours.

You can send me the dataset and I will do the training and share the trained model on google drive.
